<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mineral Admixtures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cementitious Materials</li><li>Pozzolans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mineral admixtures market encompasses two primary types: cementitious materials and pozzolans. Cementitious materials, such as fly ash and slag, enhance concrete strength and durability by chemically reacting with cement. Pozzolans, like silica fume and natural volcanic ash, react with calcium hydroxide to form additional cementitious compounds, improving concrete's properties and sustainability. Both types are vital in reducing the environmental impact of concrete production, enhancing performance, and increasing longevity, making them essential components in modern construction practices.</p></p>
