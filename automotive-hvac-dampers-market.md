<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive HVAC Dampers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the automotive HVAC dampers market, two primary actuator types are prevalent: non-spring return damper actuators and spring return damper actuators. Non-spring return dampers maintain a specific position until actively adjusted, offering precise control over airflow and temperature. Conversely, spring return dampers automatically return to a default position when power is lost, ensuring safety and reliability. Both actuator types play crucial roles in enhancing passenger comfort by regulating cabin climate effectively in vehicles.</p></p>
