<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Motorless Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The motorless water pumps market features two primary types: positive-displacement and centrifugal pumps. Positive-displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed volume of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, making them ideal for high-viscosity liquids. In contrast, centrifugal pumps use rotational energy from a spinning impeller to create flow, making them effective for low-viscosity fluids and larger volumes. Both types serve various applications, including agricultural irrigation, drainage, and industrial processes, offering energy-efficient solutions without reliance on electric motors.</p></p>
